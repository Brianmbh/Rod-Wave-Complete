# Rod-Wave-Complete
This is the completed version of a 3 part series I was experimenting with. 
I published this project with the HTML only first, the HTML and CSS only next and finally the HTML, CSS and Javascript. last. 
I did this to help myself seperate the three languages and took my time using this project to understand the concepts behind all three. 
This project a sample of a website that could be used for a freelancer entreprenure. 
This was created as a proxy site for the Soul/RB artist Rod Wave. 
The idea is that the principles and design could be converted to be used for other entreprenures like a writer, motivational speaker or athlete or other form of influencer
The javascript principals focused on were making sure that a cart element could be selected from the HTML, added to the cart, be removed from the cart and that the proper math 
could be calculated and then proxy purchased.
